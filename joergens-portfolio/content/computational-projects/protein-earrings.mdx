title: "Protein Earrings"

In my final project, I attempted to create forms using my own language. These structures are based on proteins. I generated them through Grasshopper, playing with parameters that increased or decreased the number of atoms kept from the original data, the radius of the spheres representing atoms and the “strength” of the fluid connections between spheres.

The link between the DNA encoding a protein and its functional form in the body is incredibly strong which makes the reverse engineering of a protein incredibly simple: all proteins are made up of the same 21 base amino acids, each one uniquely encoded by 3 letter sequences in our DNA. These 3 letter sequences are aptly named codons. In general, reverse engineering biological systems is always easier than the forwards direction protein folding is no exception. It is in fact one of the frontiers of modern medicine to better predict the three and four-dimensional shapes that proteins adopt based only on the sequence of the amino acids that comprise them. Proteins share this characteristic with code-driven art, that the primitive organizational rules govern and give rise to an object whose function is intimately tied to form. When a protein misfolds or denatures, it loses the closed loop of a self-referential code-based form, its shape is no longer a direct result of its underlying code.
