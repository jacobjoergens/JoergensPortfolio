# **Directions** 
In the control panel, you can use the buttons and sliders to change the model and display parameters. These are explained in the description section. The default protein is the crystal structure of sOPH, a hydrolase found in microbes shown to break down PVA plastics. However, you can search by title for any protein in the [RCSB database](https://www.rcsb.org/) to change the underlying structure. 

# **Description**
I took an architecture course at UChicago called “Complex Curves and Plastic Shapes,” which was split in half between theory and practice. The theory half was spent reading and discussing essays on and by artists—mainly sculptors. In the practical half, we tackled design assignments using Rhino, a 3D modeling software. As the course went on, I became interested in the role of codes in art on both levels. On the theoretical side, many of the artists we read explicitly referred to a set of rules endogenous to art which they argued should govern artmaking and our interpretation of it. You can read an adaptation of my final essay for that class [here](http://jacob.joergens/computational-design/sculptural-language) which muses in more depth about the emergent properties of these rule sets when viewed as codified languages. On the practical side, I started to see parallels to what I was teaching myself in Grasshopper—a plugin for Rhino which provides a programming environment to create models and explore design variations through definable parameters. 

This model and my final paper were the result of another happy accident of [crossing parallels](http://jacobjoergens.com/woodwork/sidetable). Sprinkles of Multiscale Biological Modeling and Spanish, concurrent courses I happened to be enrolled in, were mixed together in the blender of my head to get me thinking of proteins in a linguistic and sculptural sense.

The leap between proteins and language is not long. Akin to sequences of characters in a language, nearly every protein is made up of some combination of the same 22 proteinogenic amino acids and that analogy extends to scales both smaller and larger than that of amino acids. Each amino acid within a protein is encoded, with some redundancy, by one out of 64 possible three letter sequences of nucleotides (A, G, C and T), fittingly known as codons. For that reason, DNA is often referred to as the “language of life.” Across every scale, there is a readily definable vocabulary of building blocks which combine according to a grammatical structure. When it comes to proteins biochemists generally refer to four structural scales: primary structure is specified by the amino acid sequence, secondary structures are local spatial conformations (α-helices, β-sheets, turns), tertiary structure describes how an entire protein folds into a 3-dimensional shape and quaternary structure is the spatial association with different proteins. 

These organizational rules govern and give rise to an object whose function is intimately tied to form. Although the artists Katarzyna Kobro, Georges Vantongerloo and Barbara Hepworth would argue over the specifics, they all see artistic form as being a product of one or another language-forming rule set. This project was an exploration into the ways that the following (and breaking) of codes informs art. Breaking the connection between a form and its underpinning code is sometimes the best method of proving the connection exists. In biology, this happens naturally through transcriptional errors, misfolding, or denaturing all of which divorce the protein’s form from its underlying code. To study protein function and dysfunction, biologists often recreate these breaking conditions. 

The following was the central figure of my final practical project for Complex Curves. It captures and compares 9 instances of this language in use; three different protein structures pronounced over three distinct parameter sets.

My model is designed to break the protein’s form-code connection, in this case not by mimicking actual biological processes but by introducing a new, visual vocabulary and grammatical structure. Proteins allowed me to start from a point of a well established 3-dimensional language—coopting an existing language that connects the protein’s form to its underlying code across multiple structural scales. To create these earrings, I deliberately disrupted the established language using a new rule-based system. My goal was to gain a deeper, more empathetic understanding of the role of linguistics in art, as described by Kobro, Vantongerloo, and Hepworth.

At each atom position the model receives from input, it places a metaball point charge which is essentially a sphere that can meld with others at close proximity. This forms the base vocabulary of my rule-based system. The radius parameter changes the size of the spheres and the remaining inputs together form a grammar which governs the combination of these sculptural components. Parameterization allows you, the user, to use and play around with the resulting sculptural language. 

## **Trim Tolerance:** 
### Proteins are made of thousands of atoms which are, by definition, very close to one another. The model imposes a rule to trim neighboring atoms from the input data that fall within a certain distance. This parameter sets the distance or tolerance used to filter out neighbors. A higher value trims a greater number of atoms from the input data and a lower value maintains a greater number of atoms. 

## **Charge Strength:** 
### Charge strength determines the distance over which metaball charges interact. A higher value means that metaballs will meld into a single, contiguous object at greater distances. A lower value will preserve the spherical shape of metaballs in closer proximity. 

## **Smoothing Passes:** 
### The metaball point charges are wrapped in marching cubes to create a mesh. This parameter sets the number of times to run the Laplacian smoothing algorithm on polygonal meshes. A higher value yields a smoother object. A lower value preserves more of the topological features that come from the metaball charges. 

## **Scale:** 
### Changes the size of the earring hook

There are other, hidden parameters that also feed into the model’s grammatical structure. I’ve decided not to include these in the user interface for a few different reasons. The first is to try to limit artifacts. Similar to what can happen in real protein synthesis, the grammatical structure of this model is blind to input. Whereas in nature, genetic mutations might yield protein variants that take on new, unexpected functions possibly associated with disease, this model’s grammar will output mutant forms (e.g. 2D shards, disjoint volumes) if fed a particular mix of inputs. I can’t calculate which of the hundreds of thousands of possible inputs will generate artifacts but I have constrained certain value ranges and filtered out everything but the largest mesh to avoid generating artifacts. The second reason I decided to limit user-facing parameters was to keep things simple. There is quite a lot to take in as it is and the parameter space already provides a dizzying number of possible combinations to explore. The third reason was to keep things running quickly. Some of these algorithms (marching cubes and mesh refinement in particular) can become remarkably expensive from a computational standpoint. To keep the language fluent, I decided to hide parameters that might cost more than a second. 

# **Next Steps** 
First and foremost, I’d like to make some of these. If you generate a pair of earrings that you like and want to have them made, note down the parameters you used and email me at jacob.joergens@gmail.com. 

Second, I want to add some features. Off the top, it would be nice to be able to save parameters and download the 3dm file of the output geometry. 

Third, there are still some parts of the model I’d like to optimize to further reduce computational load and wait times. 

Fourth, if there’s decent interest then in the medium term I’d like to make an online storefront for these which would require some work. 

# **How It Works**
Input data is sent to a Grasshopper file which is passed to a Rhino.Compute server hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The Rhino compute server returns rhino3dm JSON data which is loaded and rendered in the browser using Three.js. There are three categories of input data: 1) parameter values, 2) display values and 3) pdb atom data. Parameter and display values are both set in the graphical user interface. Changes to display values only trigger re-renders in the browser because they only involve Three.js. All other changes trigger calls to the Rhino.Compute Server to run the grasshopper file with updated parameters. When the page loads and all the components mount, the Rhino.Compute server is called with a default protein, in this case an enzyme found to break down PVA plastics. This default PDB data can be changed from the search bar which queries the RCSB Protein Data Bank API.
