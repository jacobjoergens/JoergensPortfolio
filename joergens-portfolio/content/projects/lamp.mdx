description: I made this lamp in my first year at The Dalton High School in a studio woodworking class taught by Richard Bottwin. On the whole, Mr. Bottwin taught me a whole lot. He taught me about technique and joinery, frustration and patience, and about embracing the whacky and weird. Most present in my mind thought is what he taught me through this project (my first true furniture piece) about the ways in which wood is unlike any other material. I unfortunately lost the original sketches but I remember presenting different sketches for lamps to Mr. Bottwin twice a week, every week for the first half of the year to be told each time that I wasn't designing with wood in mind. "That's metal," he would say or "that's plastic" or more often than not "that's crazy." Thank you Mr. Bottwin, for putting wood in my mind. It hasn't left.
