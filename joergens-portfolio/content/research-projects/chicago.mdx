For all four years of my time as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago plus one after I graduated, I worked in Professor Elizabeth Moyer’s atmospheric physics lab. From 2018 to 2019, I worked together with Nathan Matteson to diagnose and troubleshoot the BEAM carbon emulator, which was designed as an alternative to DICE, the most popular integrated-assessment model at the time. Unfortunately, after running optimization algorithms and doing a brute force search of the model’s parameter space, we found that BEAM had been developed on faulty science and the project petered out. From 2020 to 2022, I redeveloped systems for the both the lab and field integrated cavity output spectrometers (ICOS). The field instrument was designed to travel onboard NASA airplanes to measure the mixing ratio of water isotopes in the upper troposphere. My primary focus was to reengineer the lab instrument to enable remote measurement of isotopic mixing ratios at the AIDA cloud chamber in Karlsruhe, Germany. In 2021, together with Ben Clouser, a post-doc in Moyer’s group, I led Mint Air through NSF’s I-Corps program at the Booth School of Business. Our aim was to explore the commercial application of using Ben’s patented innovation in non-axially symmetric optics to search for fugitive gas leaks with UAV-mounted ICOS instruments. 
A lot of the work I did with Moyer was unfortunately of the not easily documented or shared variety. The picture above is a screenshot of the lab instrument’s power management board which I designed in Eagle.
