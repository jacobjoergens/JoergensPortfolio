For three years in high school, I was a research intern in Dr. Ross Levine’s lab at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center mentored by Dr. Megan Hatlen. In 2015, I was listed as a co-author on Hatlen’s dissertation work, “Integrative Genetic Analysis of Mouse and Human AML Identifies Cooperating Disease Alleles," which was published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.20150524)). Pictured above are a screenshot of that paper and a poster I presented at the New York City Science and Engineering Fair (NYCSEF) in 2015 on treating TET2 knockout leukemias with the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine.
