# **Description:**  

My good friends Sam and Cami have a coffee table built by Sam in their Chicago apartment which I love. I love it in a nostalgic sense as the setting for drinking tea after working with Sam all day building a playground in the still wintry rain and wind coming off Lake Michigan, for the internal turmoil of restraining certain animal instincts in favor of good etiquette whenever it held plates of Cami’s baking, and for many conversations, snacks, and dog-rubbins. Sam’s coffee table saw the three of us get closer which I think speaks to the power that certain objects can wield. 

And as if that weren’t enough to ask from a craftwork, it could also be reconfigured. It’s made of two simple components that can be rotated and moved with respect to one another. I saw it take on all sorts of configurations over time, sometimes to create more space, sometimes to take up less, sometimes to allow people to sit on opposite sides, sometimes to encourage a circle. It wasn’t necessarily designed to move--there’s no hardware and there are no hinges to make the components easily pushed or rotated--but it was designed so that it could be moved. 

I was over at their place once and Sam called from the kitchen, “Jacob, you decide how to move the table, it feels like it’s about time we switch it up again." In the grander scheme, it’s such a small thing how a coffee table is oriented, and I’m fairly certain Sam didn’t intend any deeper significance by asking me to move it, but I’ve thought a lot about that moment since then. In a slightly embarrassing way, I felt honored and I’m still not quite sure why. The best explanation I’ve come up with so far is that I was there to witness something that you rarely get to see happen in yourself much less in someone else. 

The idea of changing something simply because it feels right is rarely acknowledged. We all do it all the time, we itch an itch or we get up to go to a different room or we start skipping a little walking down the sidewalk, but by the time the idea is formed the act is done and so the idea is barely conscious. I think it’s fair to say that if we ask ourselves, “Why did I just do that?” or someone else asks us, then we tend to apply some post-processed logic to form some justification: “Oh, I’m skipping cause I’m happy” or “I moved cause it’s cold in here.” To bring it out of the hypothetical, pets and little kids are regular causes for wonder, if they could speak, what reason could they possibly give for any number of the silly things they do beyond, “I don’t know, it just felt right?”

Sam’s table is beautiful and I think it’s a nice practical feature that it can be changed to serve different functions. However, I designed and built the table pictured above not to copy Sam, in fact the two tables couldn’t look much less alike, but rather as an exploration on the same theme. Objects which can be (deliberately) reconfigured carry the potential to translate the impulse for change, which is so primitive as to escape verbal explanation, into a more durable and legible state. What makes the time right for change? What goes through a person’s head as they’re changing? What makes the change feel right? When you ask these questions of an object with which you live, the answers come by living with it. That’s why I felt so honored by the (by all measures) minor moment in Sam’s apartment. You rarely get to see one of those feedback loops forming in real-time and when you do, it’s special because you momentarily lose the logic-seeking requisite of thinking-in-words and are instead able to simply feel that something is right, like a toddler or pet might. 

This table is named after Cami’s dog, Buddy, who was a wise old man when I met him and was, despite being basically blind, so skilled at feeling his way through the world.
