# **Description**  

My good friends Sam and Cami have a coffee table built by Sam in their Chicago apartment. I love it in a nostalgic sense as the setting for drinking tea after working with Sam all day building a playground in the still wintry rain coming off Lake Michigan, for the internal turmoil of restraining animal instincts in favor of good etiquette whenever it held plates of Cami’s baking, and for many conversations, snacks, and dog-rubbins. Sam’s coffee table saw the three of us get closer which I think speaks to the power that certain objects can wield. 

And as if that weren’t enough to ask from a craftwork, it could also be reconfigured. It’s made of two simple components that can be rotated and moved with respect to each other. I saw it take on all sorts of configurations over time, sometimes to create more space, sometimes to take up less, sometimes to allow people to sit on opposite sides. Sam once called from the kitchen, “Jacob, decide how to move the table, it feels like it’s about time we switch it up again." In the grander scheme, it’s such a small thing how a coffee table is oriented, and I’m fairly certain Sam didn’t intend any deeper significance, but in the world according to me, I was there to witness something that you rarely get to see happen in yourself much less in someone else. 

Changing something simply because it feels right is common, we itch an itch or we get up to go to a different room or we start skipping a little walking down the sidewalk, but by the time the idea is formed the act is done. The idea is barely conscious. If we ask ourselves, “Why did I just do that?”, then we apply post-processed logic: “Oh, I’m skipping cause I’m happy” or “I moved cause it’s cold in here.” While the logic may very well stand, it misses the more primal nature of what compelled the change.

Objects designed for reconfiguration can translate the impulse for change, which is so primitive as to escape verbal explanation, into a more legible state. When you ask these questions of an object with which you live, the answers come through living with it. You rarely get to see one of these feedback loops forming in real-time and when you do, it’s special because you momentarily lose the logic-seeking requisite of thinking-in-words and are instead able to simply feel that something is right, like a toddler or pet might. That’s why I felt so honored to witness the, by all measures, minor moment in Sam’s apartment. It’s also why I designed and built the table pictured above, as an extension of the same theme.

This table is named after Cami’s dog, Buddy, who was a wise old man when I met him and was, despite being basically blind, a very skilled practitioner of feeling his way.
