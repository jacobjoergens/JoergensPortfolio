# **Description:**  
I've lost the originals but I remember presenting different sketches for lamps to Mr. Bottwin twice a week, every week for about six months. Each time he would tell me that it looked like I was thinking in terms, be they plastic, metal, fabric, or misguided, other than wood. Then he'd launch into something loosely related like a history of a certain school of design or not related at all like belting a made up song. In hindsight, those funny songs were amazingly rich lessons in and of themselves, but in the moment they added to my frustration at not making progress. 

In every other aspect of school, progress was easily measurable. We would get through this many chapters or that many theorems in a period, so the stagnancy in Mr. Bottwin’s class was uniquely discomfiting, but it was really important. Mr. Bottwin’s eccentricities helped me appreciate the importance of getting a feel for the rhythm of what you’re learning alongside all the rest. 

In a different subject, like geometry, rhythm might mean a sort of déjà vu connected to identifying angles or the ordering of a proof or a certain motion of your pen. Subconsciously, your understanding of the material is often wrapped up with a certain sequence and duration of steps in time. There’s no sharper indicator of that than when it’s missing because the stress of a test has thrown off your internal rhythm. Who hasn’t studied for a test only to have the time-pressure seemingly wipe their mind? In guiding me through the design and construction of this lamp (my first furniture piece), Mr. Bottwin taught me many techniques, but in letting me stew, going on tangents, having me sand without a power tool and other context-informing habits, he really taught me the time signature of woodworking. 

I named this lamp after Mr. Bottwin because it still makes me happy to tap into that rhythm. I’m very lucky to have had him as a teacher.
