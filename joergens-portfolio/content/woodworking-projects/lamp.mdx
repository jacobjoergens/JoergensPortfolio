# **Description**  
This lamp is named for my first design mentor Richard Bottwin, who opened my eyes to design as an associative process as much about memory and rhythm as convention or technique. While critiquing my ideas or work, Bottwin often launched into seemingly unrelated topics or even a spontaneous made-up song. 

Because my time with him was limited, my progress on this lamp was also staccato. He was overseeing that progress and it flowed when he was in a certain mood, but stopped when he felt more like singing, napping, or dashing out for a snack. His eccentricities helped me appreciate the importance of getting a feel for the rhythm of what you’re learning alongside all the rest—to allow your associative powers to be activated beneath the surface of consciousness.  

It still makes me happy to tap into that rhythm. I’m very lucky to have had Bottwin as a teacher.
