# **Description:**  
I made this lamp in my first year at The Dalton High School in a studio woodworking class taught by Richard Bottwin. Mr. Bottwin taught me a whole lot about technique and joinery, frustration and patience, the importance of naps and letting yourself be weird. Most present in my mind though is what he taught me through creating this lamp about the ways in which wood is unlike any other material.  

I've lost the originals but I remember presenting different sketches for lamps to Mr. Bottwin twice a week, every week for the first half of the year. Each time he would tell me that it looked like I was thinking in terms, be they plastic, metal, fabric, or misguided, apart from that of wood. Then he'd launch into something loosely related like a history of a certain school of design or not related at all like belting a made up song. In hindsight, those google dives and funny songs were amazingly rich lessons in and of themselves but in the moment they merely served to aggravate a feeling of frustration I had over not making enough progress. 

In every other aspect of school, progress was easily measurable. We would get through this many chapters or that many theorems in a period, so the stagnancy in Mr. Bottwin’s class was uniquely discomfiting but it was really important. Knowledge, as in technique or synthesis of material, is obviously integral to learning, but Mr. Bottwin’s eccentricities helped me appreciate the importance of getting a feel for the rhythm alongside all the rest. To learn a topic in geometry, say, you might take a few problems of a certain type and by getting those wrong, trying again and eventually finding solutions. You come to a point where you understand the topic well enough to extend it to any problem of that type. So the topic is learned, but a secondary process is learned along the way which is rarely discussed in the classroom (I imagine because it’s so individual that it’s hardly communicable) and that is a familiarity with a sequential pattern of thoughts. 

In geometry, that might mean a sort of déjà vu connected to identifying angles or the ordering of a proof or a certain motion of your pen. Subconsciously, your understanding of the material is often wrapped up with a certain sequence and duration of steps discretized in time. There’s no clearer proof of déjà vu than when it’s missing because the stress of a test has thrown off your internal clock. Who hasn’t studied and understood the material only to get to the question and have the time-pressure seemingly wipe their mind? In guiding me through the design and construction of this lamp (my first furniture piece), Mr. Bottwin taught me many a technical aspect of woodworking, but in letting me stew, going on tangents and circling back, having me sand without a power tool and other context-informing habits, he really taught me its time signature. That’s what helped me finally start to think in terms of wood. 

I named this lamp after Mr. Bottwin because it still makes me happy to think in terms of wood. I’m very lucky to have had him as a teacher.
