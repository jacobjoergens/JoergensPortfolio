# **Description** 
In 2020, I co-founded Uncommissioned Design which was to be an online marketplace for custom furniture. We were accepted to compete in the College New Venture Challenge (CNVC), a startup accelerator program hosted by the Polsky Center at the Booth School of Business. As part of the competition, we were encouraged to find advisors. The next year, hearing that I would be finishing my graduation requirements early, an advisor hired me to work at 57th Street Design, a furniture company in Chicago. 

I was brought on to help the company jump tracks from building furniture to building cross-laminated timber (CLT) affordable housing. There ended up being a single week when my boss was on vacation, where I was able to start and complete the first draft of a parametric model for a CLT building typology. To see how that would later lead to my Minimum Rectangular Partitioning model, you can read the description [here](http://jacogbjoergens.com/computational-design/min-rect-partitioning). Another week, I built a half-scale prototype of the floor-cassette system developed by Paul Mayencourt. This is a picture of me walking on it:

Otherwise, for the overwhelming majority of the time I worked at 57th Street, I did manual labor on the shop floor. I did the crosscutting, straight-lining, panel glue-ups and planing for every piece of furniture and I did all the dovetail joinery for the pieces that required it.

Given that somewhat frustrating context, I wanted to build something unlike the straight-edge mid-century modern furniture that 57th Street churned out. Steam-bending was new to me so I wanted to incorporate that, but I didnâ€™t have a proper setup. I ended up ripping half-inch strips which I steam-bent and laminated in threes to make the five rockers in the finished piece. Using an electric tea kettle and garbage bags to keep the steam in, I worked on this rocking reclining chair as a creative outlet so as not to blow my top.
