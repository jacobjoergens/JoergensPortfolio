# **Description:** 
My good friend Seth and I would go on runs in Chicago. Chicago gets so cold that I often would have rathered to stay cozily sedentary, but Seth was a good running buddy and coaxed me out anyway. One morning we were running long enough that we ran from winter into summer. That might sound impressive but Chicago’s spring is all of an hour long so to mark the occasion we took a break where we were, by a lagoon in Washington Park. We were just sitting and talking and enjoying the weather. We both remember that conversation fondly and have often made reference to it since then but neither of us can remember what it was about anymore apart from the punchline: a resolution to grow up to be jolly old men with paunches--it seemed, from our experience, that one naturally led to the other.  

A little later on, I co-founded Uncommissioned Design which was to be an online marketplace for parametrically-designed custom furniture. To test the idea and to start generating revenue, I started taking on commissions, acting as the first fabricator on the platform. Combining metal and woodwork, I made a nightstand, a modular bed frame which could be disassembled into four ottomans, and a large coffee table. I would typically have to work on these projects during finals or midterms and at the slight expense of studying. As an unfortunate result, I never took the time to get very good pictures of the pieces before delivering them to the friends who commissioned them. I don’t have enough material to devote individual pages to these pieces but they are pictured below.

The curvy (dare I say paunchy) glass-top coffee table above is a different story. It was commissioned by Seth’s girlfriend’s mom, and I have pictures of it because it never made it to her. We had traded many phone calls and sketches to come to a final design. Everything was set, I just needed to get the material. In the height of COVID, I rented a zipcar, drove to a lumber yard, learned they were moving inventory and had a sale, and, I swear to the god I don’t believe in, this slab of American Elm spoke to me. You know what it said? Hand carve me to have curves. And I listened, despite never having carved before and ignoring the fact that the final design had straight edges. With a hammer and chisel (which I learned only after 80 hours was the wrong tool for the job) I set about exerting my artistic liberty only for Seth’s girlfriend’s mom to rightly, politely refuse the table in the end. Through this saga, I got one year older and I’d like to think a little more jolly.
