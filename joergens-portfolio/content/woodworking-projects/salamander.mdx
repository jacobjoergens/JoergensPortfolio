# **Description** 
At UChicago, I co-founded Uncommissioned Design which was to be an online marketplace for parametrically-designed custom furniture. To test the idea and to start generating revenue, I started taking on commissions, acting as the first fabricator on the platform. Combining metal and woodwork, I took on a number of projects that I typically had to work on during finals or midterms and often at the slight expense of studying. Pressed for time as I was, I unfortunately never had the time to get good pictures of all these pieces before delivering them to clients. 

This coffee table was also a commissioned piece but has a slightly different story. When I was sourcing material at a Chicago lumberyard, I swear to the god I don’t believe in, this slab of American Elm spoke to me. You know what it said? Hand carve me to have curves. And I listened, despite having never carved anything before and ignoring the fact that the final design had straight edges. I’ve named it in honor of my good friend Seth who was indirectly involved with getting the commission and who I hope to keep calling a friend into jolly old manhood. 

Some other commissioned pieces are pictured below:
