# **Description** 
In 2020, I co-founded Uncommissioned Design which was to be an online marketplace for parametrically designed custom furniture. To test the idea and to start generating revenue, I started taking on commissions, acting as the first fabricator on the platform. Combining metal and woodwork, I took on a number of projects that I typically had to work on during finals or midterms, and pressed for time as I was, failed to get great pictures of these pieces before delivering them to clients. 

This coffee table was one commissioned piece I did get to photograph. When I was sourcing material at a Chicago lumberyard, I swear to the god I don’t believe in, a slab of American Elm spoke to me. You know what it said? Hand carve me to have curves. And I listened, despite having never carved anything before and ignoring the fact that the final design had straight edges. I’ve named it in honor of my good friend Seth who was involved with getting the commission and who I hope to keep calling a friend when we’re jolly old men. 

Some of the other commissioned pieces are pictured below:
