# **Description:** 
I designed and fully assembled the table pictured above, but something was missing. While I was supposed to be putting the finish on, I cut out cardboard pieces and played around in a way more closely related to the iterative design of robotics than what I had ever seen in woodworking. I was taking tape off when my teacher came in and shouted “Stop, that’s it!” The remaining cardboard piece was what became the angled support on the table’s foot (the upturned ‘T’). That rounded out the table, and it cemented for me the importance of focusing on multiple things in parallel. 

In my experience, the naturally occurring crosses between otherwise separate fields, more like ecological edge effects than planned interdisciplinarity, are always happy accidents. Robotics and woodworking were never explicitly connected, but by way of being in those classes at the same time, they were neighboring in my head. Likewise, being in a multiscale biological modeling class alongside an architecture class gave rise to these [protein earrings](http://jacobjoergens.com/computational-design/protein-earrings). 

Another happy accident led me to build the aeroponic green wall pictured below. Knowing my background in woodwork and robotics, my environmental history teacher had asked me to design and build a grow-system for a kindergarten classroom at the Dalton School. The school unfortunately pulled the rug from under my feet at the last minute. My green wall never found a home, but in the process of researching, prototyping and building it, I got really interested in the potential benefits and ills of technology in agriculture. The green wall project inspired me to take a gap year before starting at UChicago, one half of which I spent working as an engineer at vertical farming startups in NYC and the other working on organic farms in Europe.
