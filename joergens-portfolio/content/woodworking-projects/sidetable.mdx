# **Description:** 
This is not a robotic table, although I did work next to a robotic furniture company while I was building water pipe-inspecting soft robots in Boston for a summer so I know it exists. I built this table in three weeks at the end of my first year of high school. That stood in marked contrast to the 9 months it took to finish my [lamp](http://jacob.joergens.com/woodwork/lamp), but the design came easily and I had learned enough from making my lamp that it came together swiftly.

One great thing about school is that it naturally forces you to think about things in parallel. Robotics and woodworking were never explicitly interdisciplinary but by way of being in those classes at the same time, they were parallel in my head. Likewise, being in a multiscale biological modeling class and an architecture class gave rise to these [protein earrings](http://jacob.joergens.com/computational-design/protein-earrings). On my high school robotics team, we weren’t necessarily taught all that much. We’d have mini-lessons on torque or I2C but for the most part we were left to our own devices. The one mandate was that we had to constantly and quickly iterate on designs. Cardboard, duct tape and zip ties were encouraged. Those things were never discouraged in my studio woodwork, they just weren’t considered. 

I designed and fully assembled the table pictured above but something, my teacher, Mr. Bottwin, and I agreed, was missing. While I was supposed to be putting the finish on, I cut out cardboard pieces and played around, taping them to the table, walking around to check what they did from different angles. I was taking them off when Mr. Bottwin walked in with the painting teacher and shouted “Stop, that’s it!” The one cardboard piece remaining was what became the angled support on the table’s foot (the upturned ‘T’). That rounded out the table, and it cemented for me the importance of juggling different things. The naturally occurring crosses between those things, more like ecological edge effects than planned interdisciplinarity, were always happy accidents. 

Robotics and woodworking crossed again, happily, for me at the end of high school. My environmental history teacher asked me to build a green wall for a kindergarten classroom. Unfortunately, the classroom was renovated and didn’t have the room for it so it’s been collecting dust in a closet, but it inspired me to take a gap year and work as an engineer at vertical farms in NYC.
